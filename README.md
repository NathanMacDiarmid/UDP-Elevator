Users are notified when the elevator has finished a request/move and where that request is.

   * Communication between floor, elevator, and scheduler

### Structure 
   * Floor.java accepts events from InputData.java. Each event consists of the current time, the floor request, 
   the direction of travel and the car button pressed. These events are sent to Scheduler.java

   * Elevator.java waits for the Scheduler to receive an event. It becomes active once the Scheulder.java is __ 
   with an event in elevatorQueue ArrayList. The move is executed and the new data is sent to Scheduler.java.

   * Scheduler.java is a organized messanger between Floor.java and Elevator.java. It accepts events from Floor.java
   and sends this event to Elevator.java. New data is recieved from Elevator.java and is sent to Floor.java. 

### How to run the program 

1. Open Eclipse and create a new project (File -> New -> Java Project)

2. Name the project `Iteration1` and click Finish

3. Create a package by right clicking on the `/src` directory within the project folder in Eclipse, name it `Iteration1`

4. Unzip `LA1G6_Iteration1.zip`

5. Right click on the package and click import.

7. Locate the directory in which the `Java` src files can be found. (From the Extracted zip in Step 4). From the GitHub Repo, it would be *\SYSC3303A-Project\Iteration1\src\Iteration1*

Include the following files 
  * Elevator.java

  * Floor.java

  * InputData.java

  * Main.java

  * Scheduler.java

  * UnitTests.java
    
8. Run the program with the green play button at the top

### If JUnit tests are not working after importing the project 
If there is an *x* symbol beside `UnitTests.java`, follow the intructions below. 
1. Open `UnitTests.java` and hover the mouse over the `@Test` code that is underlined red. Click on *Add JUnit 5 library to the build path*

3. Hover over the `@Test` code that is underlined red. Click on *Fix Project Setup*. Click on *Add JUnit 5 library to the build path* -> choose *org.junit.jupiter.api.Test*
